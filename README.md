## CIND820: Initial Results and the Code

# PREDICTIVE MODELING OF CERVICAL CANCER RISK FACTORS 

## Project Overview
This capstone project applies data analytics and machine learning techniques to the UCI Cervical Cancer (Risk Factors) dataset to explore predictors associated with cervical cancer screening outcomes. The analysis focuses on data exploration, preprocessing, and model evaluation, with particular attention to missing data, class imbalance, and clinical interpretability.

The analysis emphasizes data quality, handling of missing values, and interpretability of results in a healthcare context.
